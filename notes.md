# Week 1
- Algorithms
  - A well-defined computational procedure that takes some values\(s\) as input
    and produces some value\(s\) as output.
  - Design & Analysis:
    - Step 1: Specification - What is it?
    - Step 2: Verification - Is is correct?
    - Step 3: Implementation - Realize the algorithm as executable code.
    - Step 4: Performance Evaluation - Predicted performance is verified
      empirically.
